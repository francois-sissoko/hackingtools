#Security tools

#Tools that I am creating to help grow with my security background. Credit goes to Al Sweigart for the art of explaining the math. 

1. Mac Address Changer scrypt run in a bash Shell 
2. WIFI detector and jammer scrypt with text editor
3. Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption using a text based string(Limited doesn't expand to file Input Output)(simple encryption)
4. Transposition Cipher Encryption and Decryption but accounts for file Input Output
5. Added file for detecting English in text
6. Transposition Cipher Break using brute force 
7. Math Cryptotools like finding Greatest Common Denominator and Modular Inverse for Affine Cipher
8. Added code to create the affine cipher
9. Adding Vigenere Cipher Encryption and Decryption using a text based string(Limited doesn't expand to File Input and Output)
10. Added a Letter Frequency Analysis to detect the most and least common used letter distrubutions in english
11. Adding a Vigenere Dictionary Hacker to find key words through using a dictionary. It does not work for random strings of key
12. Added a Vigenere Hacker that uses Kasaski Examination Brute force is not super effiecent and can run out of memory
13. Added Prime Number module which checks if a number is prime using trial division, Sieve of Eratosthenes, and Rabin-Miller Primality Algorithm. The module uses these algorithms to generate large prime numbers.
